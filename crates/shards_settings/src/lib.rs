//! # shards_settings — player settings (E8.6)
//!
//! What a player sets in a settings screen: **graphics**, **audio**, **controls** and
//! **accessibility**, kept between runs in `settings.toml` by Bevy's own settings framework
//! (`bevy::settings`, one TOML table per group), and changed from outside by the `settings`
//! and `settings_set` tools.
//!
//! ```toml
//! # ~/.config/shards-my-game/settings.toml
//! [accessibility]
//! camera_shake = 0.3
//! flashes = "reduced"
//! fov_deg = 90.0
//!
//! [controls.bindings]
//! "gameplay.jump" = ["Key(KeyJ)", "GamepadButton(South)"]
//! ```
//!
//! - **Groups** ([`groups`]): [`GraphicsSettings`], [`AudioSettings`], [`ControlSettings`],
//!   [`AccessibilitySettings`]. Plain resources of bools, numbers and strings, read with clamping
//!   accessors (`fov()`, [`AccessibilitySettings::flash_level`]) because a hand-edited file may
//!   say anything. A game adds its own with [`SettingsAppExt::add_settings_group`]; a group that
//!   TOML cannot hold (a `u64`, a map keyed by something else than `String`) is refused at
//!   registration, naming the field ([`check_toml_safe`]).
//! - **Applying**: each module applies the groups it owns, outside the simulation: this crate
//!   puts [`GraphicsSettings`] on the primary window ([`apply_graphics`]); `shards_motion`
//!   turns [`ControlSettings`] into the input map (and `rebind` writes back), and
//!   [`AccessibilitySettings`] and the look speed into the camera; `shards_action` draws
//!   attack warnings by [`AccessibilitySettings::flash_level`]. Audio volumes are kept for the
//!   audio module.
//! - **Per machine, never simulated**: settings are not in snapshots, replays or the replay
//!   hash, and a host does not replicate them. `settings_set` is a control tool, so replays do
//!   not record it either; a change is journaled (`settings: accessibility.camera_shake 1 → 0.3`).
//! - **Persistence** ([`store`]): Bevy's plugin reads the file once, when it is added, and
//!   writes when told to. `shards::run` adds it ([`install`]) **after** the game's builder, because it scans
//!   the type registry once, and only when `EngineConfig.settings` asks for it: `--settings-dir DIR`
//!   keeps `DIR/settings.toml`, the default is the platform's settings folder under
//!   [`SettingsAppId`], `--no-settings`, tests, `--verify` and a stand's clients keep nothing (the
//!   groups are still there, as defaults), and so does a headless game unless `--settings-dir` is
//!   given. Changes are written a second after the last one ([`save_soon`]) and when the game
//!   exits.
