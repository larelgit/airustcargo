//! Navigation: the navmesh of the region (E6.1) and the nav agents that walk it.
//!
//! ## The navmesh
//!
//! Every tile (and dungeon room) is **baked** ahead of time into a grid of walkable cells
//! ([`NavTile`]): the tile's gameplay geometry is spawned alone in a scratch world by the
//! world module's own tile spawner and sampled with the motion module's terrain probe and
//! move rule ([`step_onto`](shards_motion::perception::step_onto)), so the navmesh, the
//! local planner (`path_to`) and the character controller agree on what can be walked,
//! climbed ([`CharacterParams::can_climb`]), dropped and swum. Bakes live in
//! `<assets>/nav/<tile>.navtile.ron` (rooms `.navroom.ron`), hashed against everything they
//! are made from: `--bake-nav [tiles|all]` (the game binary, [`bake_files`]) or the
//! `nav_bake` tool writes them; with a `nav` content definition ([`NavSettingsDef`]: cell
//! size, the bodies, the folder) a missing or stale one is a content error.
//!
//! **Body classes**: the tiles are baked for the `agent` body and once more for every class
//! of the nav settings' `bodies` (`large`, from the locomotion of a big enemy), each class in
//! a folder of its own (`<assets>/nav/large/<tile>.navtile.ron`), and a region builds a
//! navmesh per class. A route asks the tightest class that serves the whole body (as wide, as
//! tall, stepping, climbing and swimming as it: [`NavRegion::serving`]); a body no class
//! serves plans on the local grid with its own numbers (`npc_state` says why).
//!
//! When a region loads, its tiles are placed and turned, **carved** where solids the bakes
//! never saw stand (decor, props, colliders spawned later), **stitched** across every tile
//! edge the sockets leave open, and joined by the levels' `navlink` markers
//! ([`NavRegion`]). A tile without a fresh bake file is baked right then, with a journal
//! warning.
//!
//! A **route** ([`NavRegion::path`]) is A* over the tile graph for the corridor, grid A*
//! inside the corridor's tiles, then string pulling checked against the grid and the
//! physics world. Routes need no window and replay identically.
//!
//! ```ron
//! // content/nav/default.nav.ron
//! { "default": (cell: 0.5, agent: Some("grunt"), safe_drop: 2.0, bodies: {"large": (locomotion: Some("ogre"))}) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Nav agents
//!
//! Where an NPC walks, by which way, without bumping into the others.
//!
//! - **Routes** come from [`NavPaths`], a seam: `fn(&World, from, to, body) -> waypoints`,
//!   the body being the NPC's own [`CharacterParams`]. The default asks the navmesh of the
//!   tightest body class that serves the body inside a loaded region and the motion module's
//!   local grid planner ([`plan_path`]) with that body everywhere else (and for bodies no class
//!   serves); a game may plug in its own. A goal in plain sight ([`plain_sight`]: on the
//!   navmesh of the same class a straight line of walking links, so never over a drop or a
//!   ledge; elsewhere a cast of the body, step height to head, through the `WORLD` layer over
//!   ground without holes or deep drops) needs no route,
//!   until the body strays farther than its radius from the line that was checked (pushed,
//!   knocked back, sidestepping another): then it is looked at again from where it stands.
//!   Another is planned again when the goal moves or every [`NpcTuning::repath`] seconds,
//!   which keeps route queries few however many NPCs chase. Where there is no route the NPC
//!   holds its ground until the next plan (it never walks blindly at the goal).
//! - **Following**: toward the next waypoint at the state's speed; arrived within `within`
//!   meters of the goal.
//! - **Leash**: an NPC whose state keeps it leashed never steers out of its [`Home`] circle.
//!   Following and the leash give the velocity the route asks for ([`NavAgent::preferred`]).
//! - **Avoidance** between bodies ([`avoid`], in `NpcSystems::Drive`): sampled reciprocal
//!   velocity obstacles. An NPC on its way tries a fan of velocities around the preferred one
//!   and takes the cheapest: straying from the route costs, and so does the first collision
//!   with another NPC or a player within the look-ahead; another NPC that avoids too takes
//!   half of each sidestep; to its right when it would meet one head on, so two walkers pass
//!   each other, and on the side it took until it is past; nearly at its goal behind a body
//!   that does not make way, it waits there. The numbers are content ([`AvoidanceDef`](crate::AvoidanceDef): the
//!   tuning's, or the behaviour's own); `weight: 0` turns it off. The leash holds after it
//!   too, and the body it steers around is [`NavAgent::avoiding`].
//!
//! The result is `Intent.move_dir` (and `aim`, presses, held inputs): NPCs drive their body
//! exactly as players do. `move_to path=true` follows navmesh routes too and `path_to`
//! reports them (the motion module's [`RoutePlanner`] seam), `clearance` ends a direction
//! where the navmesh does, and `nav_path` shows routes with their tiles.
