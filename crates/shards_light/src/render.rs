//! The pictures of the content lights (the `render` feature): each `ContentLight` gets a Bevy `PointLight` or
//! `SpotLight` on a child entity (`LightPicture`), without an `AiId`, driven every frame from
//! [`LightState`](crate::LightState): its colour, power (the flicker applied), range and whether the shadow budget
//! gives it a shadow. A game's own Bevy lights are not touched.
//!
//! The light is a child so that a `ContentLight` on a body (a lamp carried by a character) follows its drawn pose, and
//! so that the entity that carries `ContentLight` gets no component the headless game lacks.
