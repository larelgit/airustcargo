//! Loading ──(loading gate open)──► EngineConfig::start_state: InGame (default) or MainMenu
//! MainMenu ──(new_game, continue_game, the game's own)──► InGame

//! The simulation never runs while the engine is `Loading` or `RegionLoading` (the
//! [loading gate](crate::loading) holds it). A trip `InGame → RegionLoading → InGame` (a
//! region change) keeps the game: `OnExit(InGame)` and `OnEnter(InGame)` do not run for
//! it, so the players a game spawned on entering `InGame` stay (the region module moves
//! them); `OnEnter`/`OnExit(RegionLoading)` mark the trip. `PauseState::Paused` is the player's pause
//! (a menu): in single player it pauses the simulation, and an agent's `resume` closes
//! it again. Pausing the simulation itself (`shards pause`, `--paused`) is a dev tool and
//! leaves `PauseState` alone, so stepping a game never pops a menu up.
