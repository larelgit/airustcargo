//! The action machine: one per fighter, for players, enemies and bosses alike.
//!
//! Presses of the fighter's moveset inputs move from `Intent` into its
//! [`InputBuffer`] and wait there up to [`CombatTuning::input_buffer`] seconds for
//! their action to become possible; one whose time runs out is rejected with the
//! reason ([`ActionRejected`], journaled). Held inputs (a block) start their action
//! whenever it is possible and loop it while held. [`can_start`] is the one rule for
//! "does this input start in the next tick, and if not, why and when": the machine
//! and the agent tools both ask it, so they never disagree.
//!
//! Timing: everything is decided between ticks. An action started in tick `N` runs
//! during tick `N` (its time goes from 0 to `dt`); it ends in the tick its time
//! reaches its length (that tick still counts: hits and defensive windows see it, the
//! state clears at the end of the tick), and the next action can start in the tick
//! after. A window is open in a tick when it touches the time that tick covered.
