//! The third-person camera (E2.5): orbit, wall collision, lock-on, aim assist, shake, FOV.
//! The lock-on rules (C6) are in [`lock`]: data (content kind `lock_on`) and plain functions
//! that the camera and the action module share.
//!
//! **Presentation only.** The simulation and the AI's `observe` never read the camera:
//! what the AI sees comes from its subject's eyes, and a window with this camera plays the
//! same game as a headless run. The one thing the camera writes into the game is the
//! lock-on target it picks, as `Intent.target` between ticks (it is input, so replays
//! record it), and, with a `lock_on` definition, the `lock_switch` presses of a flick or the
//! mouse wheel. It never takes away a target anybody else set: that is gameplay's, and the
//! camera is only where the eye happens to be. With a `lock_on` definition it lets go of none
//! by itself either: the action module checks every lock on every tick.
//!
//! The math is in [`math`] as plain functions (`orbit_position`, `resolve_camera_collision`,
//! `pick_lock_target`, `next_lock_target`, `shake_offset`, `aim_assist`); the systems that
//! drive a camera entity with it need a window and live behind the `render` feature.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Follows the entity with `LocalPlayer`:
//! commands.spawn((Camera3d::default(), AiCamera, ThirdPersonCamera::default()));
//! // A hit shakes it (when the player's setting allows):
//! commands.trigger(AddTrauma(0.4));
//! ```
