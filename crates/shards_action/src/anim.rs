//! Animation, as data and decisions: the `animset` content kind and the choice of the
//! clip a character should show.
//!
//! **Gameplay leads, animation catches up.** The action machine decides what happens and
//! when; an [`AnimSet`] only says which clip of a glTF file shows it. While an action runs,
//! its clip is *seeked* to the action's progress (gameplay time scaled to the clip's
//! length), so a hit window opens at the same moment of the animation on every machine and
//! at every frame rate. Between actions, locomotion clips (`idle`, `walk`, `run`, ...) loop,
//! at a speed that follows the character's velocity. [`select_clip`] is that decision as one
//! pure function; the systems that apply it to a Bevy `AnimationPlayer` live behind the
//! `render` feature, and nothing here needs a window.
//!
//! ## Content
//!
//! ```ron
//! // content/anim/humanoid.animset.ron
//! {
//!     "humanoid": (
//!         // One glTF holds the clips. Characters of other models share them when their
//!         // skeletons have the same node names.
//!         source: "models/humanoid.glb",
//!         // Library: our name -> the animation in the file (default: the same name).
//!         clips: {
//!             "idle": (),
//!             "walk": (),
//!             "run": (speed: 1.0),
//!             "fall": (name: "Armature|Falling"),
//!             "swing_1": (name: "Armature|Slash1", cues: [(at: 0.28, cue: "swoosh")]),
//!             "roll": (blend: 0.04),
//!             "hit": (),
//!             "die": (),
//!             // A clip from another file made for the same skeleton.
//!             "bow": (source: "models/humanoid_gestures.glb"),
//!         },
//!         // Locomotion state -> clip. Missing ones fall back (sprint -> run -> walk -> idle).
//!         locomotion: {"idle": "idle", "walk": "walk", "run": "run", "air": "fall",
//!                      "stagger": "hit", "dead": "die"},
//!         // Action id -> clip; or give the action `anim: "swing_1"`, or map its tags. (A clip
//!         // can play on a layer of the body: see "Layers".)
//!         actions: {"light_1": "swing_1", "roll": "roll"},
//!         tags: {},
//!         blend: 0.2,         // seconds between locomotion clips
//!         action_blend: 0.06, // seconds into an action's clip
//!         // What speed (m/s) the walk, run and sprint clips were made for.
//!         speeds: (walk: 2.0, run: 5.0, sprint: 8.0),
//!         // The root bone: its move along the ground is root motion (see "Root motion").
//!         root_motion: "root",
//!     ),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A character is [`Animated`] with the set's id and has the glTF scene as a child
//! (`WorldAssetRoot(asset_server.load(GltfAssetLabel::Scene(0).from_asset("models/hero.glb")))`).
//!
//! ## Layers
//!
//! An action can play on one part of the body while locomotion goes on in the rest: a flask
//! drunk while walking, a guard raised while strafing. A layer is a bone and everything below
//! it; an action's mapping says which layer its clip plays on:
//!
//! ```ron
//! {
//!     "humanoid": (
//!         source: "models/humanoid.glb",
//!         clips: {"idle": (), "walk": (), "drink": (source: "models/humanoid_gestures.glb")},
//!         locomotion: {"idle": "idle", "walk": "walk"},
//!         // The layer `upper` is the spine with the head and the arms; the legs are the rest.
//!         layers: {"upper": (root: "spine")},
//!         // The plain form (`"drink": "drink"`) plays on the whole body; this one on the layer.
//!         // Tags map the same way.
//!         actions: {"drink": (clip: "drink", layer: "upper")},
//!     ),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! While the action runs, the layer's bones follow its clip, seeked to the action's progress
//! like any other, and every other bone keeps its locomotion clip. The blends are the usual
//! ones: into the action's clip over that clip's `blend` (or `action_blend`), back to
//! locomotion over the locomotion clip's. [`select_layer`] says what plays on a layer;
//! [`select_clip_for`] chooses as if the action did not run. Picture only, like the rest of
//! the set.
//!
//! ## Root motion
//!
//! An attack's lunge and a roll's distance are in its clip: the root bone moves forward. The
//! body moves by the action's `displacement` (gameplay leads), so the curve is baked from the
//! clip: the action names it (`bake: (animset: "humanoid", clip: "roll")`) and `--bake-motion`
//! (or the `motion_bake` tool) writes the root bone's move along the ground into the action
//! ([`crate::bake`]). The picture then keeps that bone in place: the model does not walk off
//! its body. A content check with the asset folder reads the files: a clip the file lacks, a
//! root bone it lacks, a baked curve that no longer matches its clip are errors.
//!
//! ## Phases on the clip
//!
//! An action's clip is seeked evenly over the run by default: 40 % of the run shows 40 % of the
//! clip. A clip made for one action and played by another with other timings (an enemy's slow
//! swing on the hero's quick one) then shows its strike before the strike lands. A clip that says
//! which phases it was timed to (`phases`, in clip seconds, as an action's are written) is seeked
//! phase by phase instead: each phase of an action with the same phases (the same names in the
//! same order) shows its own stretch of the clip, however long the action's phase lasts.
//!
//! ```ron
//! //     clips: {"light_1": (phases: [("windup", 0.2), ("active", 0.1), ("recovery", 0.3)])},
//! // an action with phases [("windup", 0.6), ("active", 0.15), ("recovery", 0.8)] shows the
//! // clip's first 0.2 s over its 0.6 s windup, and the strike when its active phase starts.
//! ```
//!
//! A phase of open length is no stretch: name it in `loops` (`loops: ["down"]`) and its stretch of
//! the clip repeats at the authored speed for as long as the action's phase lasts (a toppled body
//! breathing for 4 s on a 1.5 s breath); the next phase starts at its own start.
//!
//! Time a run gains past its phases (a miss's longer recovery) stretches its last phase. An
//! action whose phases are not the clip's plays it evenly, as one without `phases` does;
//! the content check refuses one that shares some of the clip's phase names but not all, in
//! order (a typo or a phase left out). With the asset folder, a clip's `phases` must match the
//! file's: its `phases` extra when it has one, else its length. [`phase_seek`] is the mapping.
//!
//! ## Sockets and props
//!
//! A character can carry things: a sword in the hand, a flask on the hip. A *socket* is a place on
//! a bone; a *prop* (content kind `prop`) is the thing; `carry` says what a moveset carries and in
//! which socket, `mounts` where it goes while an action runs (or just after a weapon switch).
//!
//! ```ron
//! // content/anim/props.prop.ron
//! { "sword": (size: (0.05, 0.9, 0.02), grip: (0.0, 0.3, 0.0)) }
//! // inside an animset:
//! //     sockets: {"hand_r": (bone: "hand.R"), "hip": (bone: "hips", offset: (0.1, 0.0, 0.0))},
//! //     carry: {"player": [(prop: "sword", socket: "hand_r")]},
//! //     mounts: {"drink": (moves: [(prop: "sword", to: Some("hip"), span: Secs(0.1, 0.9))],
//! //                        on_cut: {"sword": 0.05})},
//! ```
//!
//! Where a prop sits is a state, read every frame from the action's time (a [`Span`], as an
//! action's windows are), never an edge: it is right after a join in the middle of an action, a
//! snapshot load or a hold. `on_cut`: a whole-body action that cuts a run leaves the props where
//! they were for a moment. `mounts["@moveset"]` holds the rules for the seconds after the body's
//! moveset changed (`previous` shows the old moveset's props meanwhile, `ended_by` lists the events
//! that end it). `by_moveset` renames clips per moveset (a clip family). [`mount_places`] is the
//! pure decision; the bridge spawns the props under the bone, without `AiId`.
//!
//! ## Motion modes
//!
//! What a body shows can depend on the motion mode it is drawn in (`MotionState::mode`: `ground`,
//! `air`, `water`, `glide`, `mantle`; [`MODES`]). `mounts["@mode:water"]` holds the rules while the
//! body swims (`yield_after`: they step aside while an action runs in the mode and for that many
//! seconds after it, a blade swung afloat stays in the hand); `mounts["@left:water"]` holds the rules
//! after the body left it (`wait`: the moves are read at time 0 for up to that many seconds, or until
//! the body's fade out of its clip is done; then they run, and the bridge fires [`ModeLeft`]).
//! `LayerDef::off_in` switches a layer off in a mode, and `drops` lowers the model for the seconds an
//! action runs in a mode (a swing afloat). [`mount_places`] decides the props (the order: a cut hold,
//! the running action, `@mode`, `@left`, `@moveset`, the carry socket); the clocks are the
//! simulation's, kept per body by the bridge.
//!
//! ## Cues
//!
//! A clip can carry timed [`CueDef`]s; when the animation passes one, an [`AnimationCue`]
//! event fires for the entity. Cues are for effects and sound (a footstep, a whoosh, a
//! spark), never for gameplay: hits, i-frames and cancels come from the action's own
//! timeline.
