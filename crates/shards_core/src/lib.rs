//! # shards_core — what every Shards module and game shares
//!
//! - [`EngineConfig`]: window or headless, seed, port, tick rate, assets; one value
//!   builds the whole engine (`shards::EnginePlugins::new(config)`).
//! - [`Intent`]: the only input of a character, written by keyboard, agents, network
//!   and replays, read by gameplay. One-shot [`Press`]es are consumed during a tick;
//!   [`Order`]s are carried out over many ([`follow_orders`] walks).
//! - [`EngineState`] / [`PauseState`]: loading, menu, game, pause. A game with a main menu
//!   ([`menu`]) shows it only in runs a person may be at ([`MenuLaunch`]); time stands there.
//! - [`LoadingGate`]: the simulation starts only once everything is loaded, so loading
//!   never shifts a tick.
//! - [`EngineModules`]: which engine modules run, shown in `ai/status` under `engine`.
//!
//! Gameplay runs in `FixedUpdate`, in `SimSet` order: the engine's own systems are in
//! [`CoreSystems`] so a game can order its systems against them.
