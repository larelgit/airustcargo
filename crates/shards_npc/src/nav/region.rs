//! [`NavRegion`]: the navmesh of the region in the world, stitched from its tiles' bakes.
//!
//! Built when a region loads (the world module's [`RegionLoadedHooks`]), inside the call
//! that loads it, so no tick ever sees a region without it:
//!
//! 1. **Bakes**: each tile (and room) of the manifest, once per id: its bake file when the
//!    file is fresh (its hash matches the definition), else baked now, with a journal
//!    warning naming the files to bake (`--bake-nav`).
//! 2. **Placing**: every placed tile is an instance of its bake, turned with the tile. A
//!    bake is in its tile's own frame, so turning never touches its links; positions and
//!    directions turn on the way out.
//! 3. **Carving**: solids the bakes never saw (decor, props, a neighbour's wall reaching
//!    over the edge, colliders spawned later) switch off the nodes the body no longer fits
//!    on, checked with the motion module's terrain probe in the assembled world.
//! 4. **Stitching**: across every tile edge the region's sockets leave open (the world
//!    module's [`RegionGraph`](shards_world::RegionGraph)), each boundary node gets the move
//!    the motion planner would make into the facing column; edges whose sockets are not
//!    passable stay closed, whatever the geometry.
//! 5. **Navlinks**: level markers `navlink` with a `to` are one-way links from the node at
//!    the marker to the node at `to`, for the moves the body makes: a drop of any depth, a
//!    climb within its mantle height, a step to the next column (`nav_info` says why
//!    another is not used: the body has no jump).
//! 6. **The tile graph**: portals (one per side and area of each tile), the costs between
//!    them inside each tile, the links between tiles; and which nodes reach which at all.
//!
//! Every body class of the nav settings has its own navmesh, built the same way from its own
//! bakes: the region's [`NavRegion`] is the `agent`'s, the others are in its
//! [`bodies`](NavRegion::bodies). A route asks the tightest class that serves its whole body
//! ([`NavRegion::serving`]).
//!
//! Afterwards, every tick (and in tools), solids that spawned, went or moved since are
//! carved out or back in, and the links across tile edges near them made again: a node
//! is off when some solid its bake never saw stands in the body's way there **now**, so the
//! navmesh never depends on the order solids came and went in.
//!
//! Everything is a pure function of the manifest, content and the static solids standing
//! in the physics world, built in a fixed order: the same region gives the same navmesh, so
//! NPC routes replay, and a game loaded from a snapshot (which builds it again) goes on
//! with the navmesh the saved game had.
