//! The navmesh of a voxel region ([`Layout::Volume`]): baked in memory, chunk by chunk, when the
//! region loads.
//!
//! A region of tiles reads or makes one bake per tile id and places it. A volume has no tiles:
//! its chunks (the manifest's cells, `tile_size` m across) are the bakes, each a square of the
//! grid sampled at its place in the world ([`Frame`](super::super::bake::Frame): the region's
//! corner and the chunk's first column), through the same flood, move rule and assembly as a
//! tile's. They are stitched across every chunk edge (all open: ground has no sockets) as the
//! edges of tiles are, carved by the solids placed in the region after it was made, and
//! queried as any navmesh is: the chunks are [`Instance`]s, turned by nothing.
//!
//! - **What a chunk is a function of**: the voxel field and the water volumes of the region
//!   (the sea is no chunk's: the bake covers the grid only), the body class's numbers and the
//!   chunk's place. Not the other colliders placed in the region: they carve the navmesh as they
//!   carve a tile's, and a chunk bake keeps no [`BakedCollider`](super::super::tile::BakedCollider).
//!   [`ChunkKey`] says so, and a chunk bake is kept under it in [`NavBakes`] (and in a process-wide
//!   cache, so the twins of heavy mode and snapshot loads bake nothing twice).
//! - **Parallel, ordered**: the chunks of a body class that are not kept are baked on the compute
//!   task pool, each a pure function of the field; the results are put in chunk order before
//!   anything is assembled, so the navmesh does not depend on which thread finished first.
//! - **Only machines that simulate** bake ([`rebuild`](super::rebuild)).
//! - Nothing is written to `assets/nav/`, and content checks ask for no bake file: no tile or
//!   room names a chunk.
