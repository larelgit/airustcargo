//! Kinematic character controller: the only thing that moves characters.
//!
//! Gameplay writes a [`LocomotionInput`] before `SimSet::Move`
//! ([`intent_to_locomotion`](crate::intent_to_locomotion) fills it from `Intent`, the
//! action machine adds its displacement);
//! [`move_characters`] turns it into motion with shape casts against the world
//! ([`PhysicsWorld`]) and keeps the result in [`MotionState`]. Actions never move a body
//! themselves: a dodge roll is [`LocomotionInput::external`], integrated here with
//! everything else. The numbers come from content ([`CharacterParams`], kind
//! `locomotion`), read again every tick, so editing the file changes the next step.
//!
//! Modes ([`MotionMode`]): **Ground** walks, runs and sprints, follows slopes up to
//! `max_slope_deg`, steps onto obstacles up to `step_height` and snaps down stairs;
//! **Air** falls with gravity and some air control; **Glide** falls slowly and rides
//! updrafts; **Water** floats at the surface; **Mantle** climbs onto a ledge along a
//! path checked before it starts. Characters never collide with each other through
//! casts: after all of them moved, a separation pass pushes overlapping capsules apart.
//!
//! The transform's translation is the character's feet. Writing it from outside (the
//! `teleport` tool, a respawn) puts the character there afresh: no speed, no fall, no
//! climb carried over from where it was.
